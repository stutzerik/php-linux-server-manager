** This project is my thesis, so it is not my life's work. My basic goal with it is to create a reference and explain my thinking to my future partners. However, if someone wants to develop it further, I am open to it.


## Used libraries & literature
I used open source libraries during development.
- Backend: Secureimage, TorUtils, PHPMailer
- Frontend: MDB4, Jquery 3, Bootstrap 4, FontAwesome 5 Free, ApexCharts, DataTables 1.13, ParticlesJS, "font-logos", "flag-icons" 

** I also indicated the frameworks, libraries and literature used for the project on the user interface of the application, thereby complying with the `open source` licenses.
